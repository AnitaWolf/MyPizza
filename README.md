1. Project Description and Objectives:
   The "Pizza Cafes" project is being developed to create an application that allows users to find pizzerias and order pizza. Users will be able to search for pizzas by name, view the cafe menu, and place orders within the application.

The main goal of the project is to develop a software solution that optimizes operational processes and provides convenience for users in pizza search.
